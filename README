1. Overview
===========

A UCESB program can read and unpack event-wise experimental data from
e.g. nuclear physics experiments, on a format given by a C-like
structure description.  Note that any UCESB-based unpacker program
needs an user-written data-format specification, from which code is
generated and then compiled together with the generic UCESB sources.
A particular aim of the system is efficiency, performance and
ease-of-use.

The system has facilities for acting as a Swiss Army-knife to
manipulate and transport data over the network, making itself a
valuable companion in the DAQ toolbox.  The default mode is to perform
strict checks, thus the name:

UCESB - unpack & check every single bit

Easy access to the various data members is provided in user functions,
as well as hbook ntuple files, root trees, or plain C structures.  The
latter in any program via the network.  Several common data quality
monitoring modes are available.  General operation is command-line
driven.

3. File formats
===============

The file format for an unpacker is a compile time option, essentially
given together with the data format specification in the build
process.  UCESB has been adapted to handle various file formats
produced by several different DAQ systems:

LMD   List mode data, produced by the MBS system from GSI.
EBYE  Data from the Daresbury MIDAS system.
PAX   KVI data.
HLD   HADES experiment (at GSI).
RIDF  RIBF Data Format (RIKEN).

Note that data formats are sometimes ill-documented, ambiguous in
their definitions, or even forked with minor modifications by
individual experiments.  Thus it happens that some adaption is
required when handling a data from a new experimental setup.  The
author is interested in information about such cases.  Extending the
system to handle also other file formats is another stimulating
activity.


4. Compilation
==============

All necessary configuration is performed during build.  To
e.g. compile the simplest LMD format unpacker, issue:

make empty

If you have an .lmd file at hand, the integrity of its event packing
can then be investigated:

empty/empty <filename>

If no such file is available, the process can be simulated:

file_input/empty_file --lmd | empty/empty --file=-


5. Documentation
================

Comprehensive documentation of command-line options for use with
existing unpackers, as well as descriptions of how to write a new data
format specification, can be found in the write-up, available at the
UCESB webpage:

6. Contributors
===============

Since its inception in 2006, the system has been used as the first
processing stage of data from many experiments.

The many suggestions for improvements, bug reports, direct code
contributions, discussions as well as intriguing support requests is a
great joy of the author, and deeply appreciated!
